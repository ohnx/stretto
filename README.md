### Live Demo
You can view a version I have hosted on my personal server at [http://music.kaiserapps.com/](http://music.kaiserapps.com/).

To have the full functionality and to use your own music please follow the install instructions below.

The music I have used for the hosted version is copyright of [Social Club](http://martymar.goodcitymusic.com/).
To purchase or download their music visit [their website](https://socialxclub.bandcamp.com).

### User Installation Instructions

Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto/releases) for the latest release, and select the download for your platform. Unzip the download and run either the `Stretto.exe` on Windows, `Stretto.app` on Mac or the `Stretto` executable on Linux.

### Dev Installation Instructions
##### Dependencies

[node](http://nodejs.org/), [git](http://git-scm.com/), [npm](http://npmjs.org)

If you have any issues during install, make sure you are running the latest version of Nodejs and Npm.

For the Youtube download and converison, make sure you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed on your system (including all necessary encoding libraries like libmp3lame or libx264).
Windows users can install ffmpeg from [Zeranoe](http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/).

After all the dependencies have been installed, run these commands to install the music player:
```
git clone https://github.com/benkaiser/stretto.git
cd stretto/
npm install
```

Then run the server with:
```
node app.js
```

Alternatively, install PM2 (read more about PM2 at [pm2.keymetrics.io](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/))with `npm install -g pm2` and run the server persistently with:
```
pm2 start app.js
```

Go to `localhost:2000` in your browser (or known IP of server if it is on a different machine). From there a prompt will allow you to change your music directory, after saving your music directory you can click `Scan Library -> Regular Scan` at the top of the page. From there select `Start Scan` and let it do it's magic adding all the songs to your library. Happy listening!

### Submitting issues

Please include:

- operating system
- architecture (32bit or 64bit)
- nodejs version `node --version`
- npm version `npm --version`

Then include steps to reproduce followed by what you were aiming to do / expected to happen, and what did happen.

### Android Sync App

If you want to sync your Stretto playlists to your phone, [check out the android sync app repository](https://github.com/benkaiser/android-node-music-sync).

### Remote Control Shortcuts

If you would like to hook up keyboard shortcuts to play/pause/next/prev when you aren't currently focused
on the chrome follow these steps:

1. first set your remote name from the `Remote Setup` button in the bottom right.
![set_remote_name](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/608054/6090658/9520f106-aecc-11e4-9d77-1a1822ade842.jpg)

2. In whatever program you use to configure your shortcuts, link the button press you want to curl commands of the format:
`curl http://localhost:2000/command/<remote_name>/<command>` where `<remote_name>` is the remote name you entered and  `<command>` can be either `next`, `prev` or `playpause`.
For an example, here is my i3 config bindings that hook up Alt+PgDn, Alt+PgUp and Alt+Home to the commands:
```
bindsym $mod+Home exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/playpause
bindsym $mod+Next exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/prev
bindsym $mod+Prior exec curl http://localhost:2000/command/my_remote_name/next
```
